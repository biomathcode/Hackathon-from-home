Further, energy can either be stored (battery & EV’s) or consumed (homes). The exchange would seek to enable each consumer – who might have energy generation and storage capabilities – to optimize their energy consumption, either on a carbon footprint or cost basis. In our example, each node has a unique supply or demand curve which differs over time, our solution should enable overall system optimization.",
