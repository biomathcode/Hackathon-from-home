    "text": "Whenever energy is generated, the system will have to decide the optimal use of it. This can range from selling, storing or consuming. For each of these actions an underlying criteria can be set. For example, for make high returns / lower costs we would look to sell energy whenever we can by any for cheaper. We could also store the produced energy if the price of the renewable source on the network is within defied limits. Storage capabilities also enable the user to sell the stored energy back onto the network as well. "
